# Workshop PreReq Setup

This takes a little time on a good internet connection, but might take a long time on a slower / shared internet connection at the conference. Doing these steps at home before attending the workshop allows us to make the most of the time we have together.

We'll discuss the process at the workshop.

For now, follow the instructions below to get setup.

## Create a folder for workshop

This workshop is going to bring together a few pieces

- Headless ContentBox
- Dev Blog App 
- Vue Hobby Blog App 

Maybe a few more after you leave the workshop.

To organize all of these items, please create a parent directory to put all of our apps in. Make sure this is not too heavily locked down by security, or you might get a few weird issues throughout the workshop.

From now on, we'll refer to this directory as `/your/workshop/directory`
